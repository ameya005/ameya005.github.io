I am a third year PhD student at NYU Tandon, being advised by [Dr. Chinmay Hegde](http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~chinmay/). I was previously a PhD student at Iowa State University with Dr. Hegde and [Dr. Soumik Sarkar](http://web.me.iastate.edu/soumiks////principal-investigator.html). My primary research areas are **Robust Learning of deep neural models** and **Generative Adversarial Models for Physics Constrained models**. I graduated with Bachelors(Hons.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani, Goa.

I used to be a Lead Computer Scientist at [Sigtuple Inc.](www.sigtuple.com) and worked on learning based systems for medical images.
