I am currently a Research Scientist at Instadeep Ltd., Cambridge, MA. I will be working on genomics and bio-related AI solutions leveraging and trainng foundation models.

I graduated with a PhD from NYU Tandon in 2023, and was advised by [Dr. Chinmay Hegde](https://chinmayhegde.github.io/) during my time there. I was previously a PhD student at Iowa State University (2018-2019) with Dr. Hegde and [Dr. Soumik Sarkar](http://web.me.iastate.edu/soumiks////principal-investigator.html). My primary research areas are **Robust Learning of deep neural models** and **Generative models with structured constraints**. I graduated with Bachelors(Hons.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani, Goa in 2014.

I interned at Meta as a Machine Learning SWE in the Instagram Reels Ranking team in summer'22. Here, I built ensemble based ranking models for Reels Ranking for various surfaces that improved user engagement by increasing training periodicity from daily to hourly.

I interned at Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI), Pittsburgh under the supervision of [Dr. Leonid Boytsov](http://searchivarius.org/about) and [Dr. Filippe Condessa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipe-condessa-86a41730/) in the summer of 2021 where I worked on Randomized Smoothing for Video Classifiers. 


I used to be a Lead Computer Scientist at [Sigtuple Inc.](www.sigtuple.com) and worked on learning based systems for medical images (retinal and radiological).
